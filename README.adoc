= Hello World!

This particular README is intended to help me learn Asciidoc.

This repository is meant to be a test bed for increasingly silly ways to print "Hello World!". It is meant only to document my programming journey. As I learn new ways to code, I will add new ways to output those two simple words.

I have never actually written a README before. I doubt there will be any meaningful ways to interact with this project so this README will probably just remain a statement of purpose.
